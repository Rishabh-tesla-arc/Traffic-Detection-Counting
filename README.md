<p id="description">This project implements a real-time traffic detection and counting system using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model and the SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) algorithm. The system is designed to process video footage whether from pre-recorded files or live camera feeds to identify and track vehicles dynamically. By combining the robust object detection capabilities of YOLO with the efficient tracking mechanism of SORT it achieves accurate and consistent tracking of individual vehicles even across frames. The system works by drawing a virtual line in the video frame which serves as a counting threshold. Vehicles are counted when their center points cross this line with each vehicle assigned a unique ID to prevent duplicate counting. Additionally the system displays bounding boxes tracking IDs and a real-time vehicle count on the processed video stream making it an intuitive and effective tool for traffic analysis.</p>
